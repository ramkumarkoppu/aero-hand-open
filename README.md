![Aero Hand Overview](assets/banner.png)

Aero Hand Open is an open-source, tendon-driven robotic hand designed and developed by TetherIA. The project aims to make dexterous manipulation research more accessible by providing a fully documented, modular, and affordable platform that can be reproduced with standard 3D printing and off-the-shelf electronic components. 

Unlike many existing robotic hands that rely on expensive proprietary actuators or complex mechanical assemblies, Aero Hand Open focuses on simplicity, reliability, and transparency. Each joint is optimized for mechanical efficiency by using tendon actuation, enabling smooth and natural motion while keeping the overall design lightweight and compact. The system integrates open-source firmware (ESP32-based) and control software compatible with ROS2, allowing seamless integration into research and educational environments. 

This repository serves as a complete open hardware and software reference for developers, students, and robotics enthusiasts.

# Resources
## Bill of Materials (BOM)
The complete list of components required to build Aero Hand Open can be found here:

 👉 Aero Hand Open – Bill of Materials

This document includes all mechanical, electronic, and printed parts — such as motors, tendons, bearings, fasteners, and 3D-printed components.

Each item is listed with its part number, vendor, quantity, and estimated cost to help you easily source or substitute parts.

CAD Files and 3D Models
All CAD and 3D model files of Aero Hand Open are available in the directory.

You can find both STEP and STL files for modification and direct 3D printing.

> CAD Files Notes:
> The absolute origin of the full assembly is at the MCP joint of middle finger

For quick setup, we also provide a “One-Click Print Pack”, which contains all parts with pre-oriented build angles optimized for print strength, surface quality, and minimal support usage.

Simply load the files into your slicer and start printing — no additional rotation or manual adjustment is required.

Printing Notes:
- Suggested Printer: Bambau Lab X1C/P1S
- Recommended material: PLA (for stiffness and dimensional accuracy)
- Suggested layer height: 0.2 mm (Nozzle Diameter 0.4mm)
- Support: Autogenerate is fine
- The hand design is fully modular — individual fingers can be printed and replaced independently
- Other information can be found in Assembly Documents

An online Onshape model is also available for quick viewing and part reference:

 👉 Aero Hand Open – Onshape Document

## Assembly Guide
The step-by-step assembly instructions for Aero Hand Open are provided in the following document:

 👉 Aero Hand Open – Assembly Guide (PDF)

This guide covers the entire build process, from mounting the actuators to routing the tendons and connecting the electronics. Each finger module can be assembled independently and attached to the palm afterward, allowing easier maintenance and quick replacement.


## Software SDK
We provide basic introduction and usage here. A detailed introduction to SDK is included in the following folder.

 👉 [`sdk/README.md`](https://github.com/TetherIA/aero-hand-open/blob/main/sdk/README.md)

### Installation: 
📦 Install via pip
```bash
pip install aero-hand-sdk
```
     
🧩 Install from source (editable mode)
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TetherIA/aero-open-sdk.git
```
     
Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
```bash
cd aero-open-sdk
```

Install the package in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### One-Time Setup
When setting up your hand for the first time, our setup GUI helps you configure motor IDs and test motor connections.
After installation, launch the Setup GUI with:
```bash
aero-hand-gui
```

This provides an interactive interface to configure your hand.

### Sequencing Demo
The Sequencing Demo demonstrates how different finger motions can be combined into continuous, pre-defined sequences.

This script enables users to perform complex gestures — such as pinching, opening the palm, or making a peace sign — by automatically coordinating joint movements in a timed sequence.

You can find the example code in the SDK example folder. 

👉 [`sdk/examples/`](https://github.com/TetherIA/aero-hand-open/tree/main/sdk/examples)

Once the SDK is installed and the serial port has been configured, you can run any of the example scripts directly using Python as follows:

```bash
python run_sequence.py
```

## Teleoperation
The Teleoperation Module enables real-time remote control of Aero Hand Open using data gloves + robotic arms or compatible robotic interfaces. It allows users to map human finger motions to the robotic hand for intuitive grasping and manipulation experiments.

# Disclaimer
Aero Hand Open is an open-source research prototype intended for educational and experimental purposes only.

While every effort has been made to ensure build accuracy and functionality, this design has not been validated for prolonged or heavy-duty use.

Users should exercise caution when assembling, operating, or modifying this device. TetherIA Inc. and its contributors shall not be held liable for any personal injury, property damage, or other losses resulting from the use, misuse, or modification of this design. By using this project, you acknowledge and accept full responsibility for any associated risks.

Important Notes:
- 3D-printed parts may exhibit tolerance variations depending on printer and material settings.
- The tendon-driven mechanism requires regular tension adjustment to maintain consistent motion.
- Overloading the joints or applying excessive torque may cause mechanical deformation or servo damage.
- This project is provided as is, without any warranty or guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose.

We encourage the community to share improvements, feedback, and modifications through pull requests or GitHub discussions.

Your contributions will help make Aero Hand Open more reliable and versatile for the entire robotics community.
